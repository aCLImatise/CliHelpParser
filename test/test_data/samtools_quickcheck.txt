quickcheck: invalid option -- '-'
Usage: samtools quickcheck [options] <input> [...]
Options:
  -v              verbose output (repeat for more verbosity)
  -q              suppress warning messages

Notes:

1. By default quickcheck will emit a warning message if and only if a file
   fails the checks, in which case the exit status is non-zero.  Under normal
   behaviour with valid data it will be silent and has a zero exit status.
   The warning messages are purely for manual inspection and should not be 
   parsed by scripts.

2. In order to use this command programmatically, you should check its exit
   status.  One way to use quickcheck might be as a check that all BAM files in
   a directory are okay:

	samtools quickcheck *.bam && echo 'all ok' \
	   || echo 'fail!'

   The first level of verbosity lists only files that fail to stdout.
   To obtain a parsable list of files that have failed, use this option:

	samtools quickcheck -qv *.bam > bad_bams.fofn \
	   && echo 'all ok' \
	   || echo 'some files failed check, see bad_bams.fofn'
